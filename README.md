# NewFilePrompt

A Sublime Text 3/4 plugin to give users a very minimal, non-intrusive and fast way to create new files and folders.

# Installing

Currently this plugin is not on Package Control so manual installation is required. Clone this repository inside your 
`/path/to/sublime-text-config/Packages` directory and restart Sublime Text.

After installations you will see two new entries inside sidebar context menu: `NewFilePrompt: Create New File` and 
`NewFilePrompt: Create New Folder` 

_Note: Bash like expansions are supported. (e.g `main.{cpp,h}` will create two files: `main.cpp` and `main.h`)_
